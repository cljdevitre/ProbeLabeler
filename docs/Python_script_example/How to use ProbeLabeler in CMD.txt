If you use ProbeLabeler from a command line, you will need to install Python (either directly or through Anaconda or Mamba, etc)

Here is an example of command sequences using Anaconda (note: for clarity, cmd commands are tabbed in this document):

	conda activate my_env
	pip install "file:C:/ProbeLabeler" 

Next, navigate to the folder where the script is contained
	cd docs/Python_script_example

Now, let's run the script
	python an_single_image.py

This will run the code for labeling a single image. This is an example, it will work with the example provided in ProbeLabeler.

!!!!!!!!!!!! NOTE : Once you're ready to run your own, make sure to go into the script and edit necessary fields to work with your own images and data.
